What is TypeScript? 

// JavaScript and More
TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor. 

// A Result you can Trust 
TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

// Safety at Scale
TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without addional code. 


// Making a new project in Typescript with React 
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript 

// Typescript basics 

let name: string;
let age: number | string;
let isStudent: boolean;
let hobbies: string[]; // || let hobbies: number[];
// This is called tuple
let role:[number, string];

let pringName: (name:string) => void;

interface Person {
  name: string; 
  age?: number;
}

interface Guy extends Person {
  profession: string;
}
 
// When you're using objects 
// If you use ? it mean it can be opitonal 
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
};

let person: Person = {
  name: "Piyush",
  age: 5,
};
