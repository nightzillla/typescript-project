What is TypeScript? 

// JavaScript and More
TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor. 

// A Result you can Trust 
TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

// Safety at Scale
TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without addional code.
